Impossible colors 
or forbidden 
colors are hues 
that cannot be 
perceived in 
ordinary viewing 
conditions from 
light that is a 
combination of 
various intensities 
of the various 
frequencies of 
visible light. 
Examples of 
impossible colors
 are bluish-yellow
 and reddish-green.[1] 
This does 
not mean 
the muddy brown
 color created 
when mixing red a
nd green paints, 
or the green 
color from 
mixing yellow 
and blue paints
, but rather 
colors that appear 
to be similar 
to, for example,
 both red and 
green, or both 
yellow and blue. 
Other colors 
never 
experienced in 
ordinary viewing, 
but perceivable 
under special 
artificial laboratory 
conditions, would 
also be termed 
impossible colors.
