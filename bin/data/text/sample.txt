Impossible colours
or forbidden
colours are hues
that cannot be
perceived in
ordinary viewing
conditions from
light that is a
combination of
various intensities
of the various
frequencies of
visible light.
Examples of
impossible colours
 are bluish-yellow
 and reddish-green.[1]
This does
not mean
the muddy brown
 colour created
when mixing red a
nd green paints,
or the green
colour from
mixing yellow
and blue paints
, but rather
colours that appear
to be similar
to, for example,
 both red and
green, or both
yellow and blue.
Other colours
never
experienced in
ordinary viewing,
but perceivable
under special
artificial laboratory
conditions, would
also be termed
impossible colours.
